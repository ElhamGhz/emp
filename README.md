# Empowerment Maximization 
Channel capacity of a communication channel is also called "Empowerment". It measures the maximum number of future states that a system can potentially reach. Empowerment has application in the field of reinforcement learning as a proposed measure of internal reward of an agent.

I uploaded our team's paper on empowerment calculation/optimization on my repository. You can find my implementation of the paper available in this repository.
