    "        return min(self.__items)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before revealing the O(1) solution, let's make some observations:  \n",
    "What does $O(1)$ suggest?  \n",
    "Ans: If we need to support efficient query operation, taht usudally indicates we need to do indexing. Since right now we are asked to be $O(1)$, we basically need to directly index the answer to out query so that when it is asked it will be available already.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to index?  \n",
    "We know we need to store the minimum item directly so that we could give our answer in $O(1)$. Let's look at one small example.  \n",
    "* At first the queue is empty, then we enqueue 5. By now we store 5 as the current minimum.  \n",
    "* Next, we euqueue 3, what should we do? Do we need to keep both?  \n",
    "Ans: Since $3 < 5$, we know 3 is the smallest item in the current queue. Since 5 is inserted earlier, 5 will be dequeued earlier, thus the fact that 3 is the minimum will not be changed. Based on this, we can update the minimum that we store from 5 to 3 directly.\n",
    "* So in summary, we will keep the minimum item among all items that are enqueued so far directy and if the new item is smaller, we will update accordingly. What if the new element is larger? What should we do?  \n",
    "Ans: Since new item is larger, we know that the current minimum is still the one that we stored. But since this minimum might be dequeued in the future, if we do not keep the current new item, we cannot know what the new minimum would be unless we do a full scan. Thus, we need to also keep the current new item since it is a valid candidate to be considered as new minimum item. Let's use a simple example also, assuming the new item is 6, then we know that the current minimum is not changed, it is still 3. But we also need to store 6 since it will be the new minimum if all items before 3 as well as 3 itself are dequeued.\n",
    "* Assuming the next new item to be enqueued is 4. What will happen?  \n",
    "Ans: Now, our minimum is still 3, this is not changed. But since 6 is inserted before 4, it will always be dequeued earlier than 4, thus 6 will never be the new minimum after all items before 3 as well as 3 itself are dequeued because 4 is smaller than 6. 4 will be a better candidate, so we can safely drop 6 and replace the candidate to be 4.\n",
    "* Assuming the next new item to be enqueued is 1. What will happen?  \n",
    "Ans: Based on a similar analysis, we know we can safely drop both 3 and 4 together and replace 1 as the current minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: queue 5, 3, 6, 4, 1  \n",
    "Add a min to cache the current minimum value.\n",
    "1. Enqueue 5, min = 5. \n",
    "2. Enqueue 3, because 3 < min, min = 3. \n",
    "3. Enqueue 6, mins {3, 6}.\n",
    "4. Enqueue 4, mins {3, 4}.\n",
    "5. Enqueue 1, mins {1}.  \n",
    "mins can be a queue, specifically duque.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conslusion:  \n",
    "Based on those above, we know we need to store multiple items as candidates to be considered as the minimum item and they should be organized **by their enqueue timestamp** (from the earliest to the latest). After arranging them in such way, we can see that this is a nondecreasing sequence and the **first candidate** will be the current minimum item among all items that are stored in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we consider the appropriate data structure to organize all our candidates, what will be the answer?  \n",
    "Ans: We can use another queue! The words that are bold in the previous sections is the requirement for picking DS and they matches to be characteristics of a queue perfectly!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the time complexity for enqueue?  \n",
    "Ans: Amortized O(1). Every item will be at most enqueue into and dequeue from the queue of candidates for minimums once."

    "### 3.1.2 Stack\n",
    "If we adopt **last-in-first-out** policy, we have a implementation called stack. Basically, you can think of this collection as a pile of dishes. Every time you want to serve some foods, you will pick a dish from the top of this pile. Every time you are done with the food and have washed your dish, you will return it to the pile and put it on the top.  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "push 1\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "        |_1_|\n",
    "push 2\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "        | 2 |\n",
    "        |_1_|\n",
    "take out one element from stack, 2 will be your result since it is the last (top) element being inserted in our queue.\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "        |   |\n",

When you surf the internet, you can always revisit the previous most recently visited page by clicking the back button in the browser. This LIFO (last-in-first-out) policy gives us an advantages of seeing interesting stuffs as soon as possible.\n",

    "Key observations:\n",
    "1. Every expression will be evaluated to a single value eventually.\n",
    "2. Based on the definition, we could have a sub expression being nested within another expression like the following: (integer + sub_expression). This means, in order to evaluate this expression, we need to first evaluate the subexpression and then use its result. This suggests that whenever we evaluate an expression, we need to look at the results of two most recently evaluated expressions. Evaluation requires knowing the operator we want to apply, following the same logic, we need to look at the most recently encountered operator.\n",

    "\n",
    "Algorithm:  \n",
    "Iterate through all those terms. Whenever we encounter the right bracket, it means we get all the information ready for evaluating an expression, we get the two relevant operands and operators from stacks, get the result and then put it back into the operand stack so that the result will be available to be used in another round of evaluation. For other cases, just simply push the term onto the dedicated stack."
