This is a major-ish limitation rather than a major one because any recursive function can be re-implemented in an iterative way, but still, it’s a hassle. As for the minor limitation, that actually leads us into the next solution…"

    "So what’s better about this version than the recursive, depth-first solution? Not a ton, but it has a few benefits. First off, it’s not recursive, meaning it can run for extremely large values without crashing. Second off, it uses constant memory, because it only ever needs two arrays of fixed size rather than the ever-growing cache of the memoization solution. Finally, it’s still linear time: I can compute 200,000 hops in just under twenty seconds."
