    "### 9.1.1 What is backtracking 回溯法\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that recursion is a really powerful tool for designing algorithm. Generally speaking, in reality, we know how to solve some basic problems. For any other problem, the most common technique is to try to reduce these new problems to those existing basic problems we are familiar with. Recursion is a special kind of reduction that reduces the problem to one or more simpler instances of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier lectures, you are exposed to these certain recursion algorithms: merge sort, quick sort, etc. All of them have a common pattern called divide and conquer 分治法:\n",
    "1. Divide the instance of the problem into several independent smaller instances.\n",
    "2. Solve these smaller instances by recursion.\n",
    "3. Gather all those results and combine them in a way to get the correct answer for the original instance of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, some problems are hard to expressed in this divide and conquer recursion manner. In this case, we often resort to another common recursion strategy called backtracking. 该类问题特点：多阶段/多步骤决策问题。破题思路：穷举法。Basically, at the high level, it involves building a set of candidates incrementally and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be a valid solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of the meaning of \"building a set of candidates incrementally\". Assuming right now you want to make a cake, there are 3 steps: picking a certain type of flour, cream and fruit. Let's say, right now, we have 3 types of flour, 2 types of cream and 6 types of fruit. How do we generate all the possible recipes of making cakes out of these materials?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest form, we can have something like the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cakes = []\n",
    "for flour in [flour1, flour2, flour3]:\n",
    "    for cream in [cream1, cream2]:\n",
    "        for fruit in [fruit1, fruit2, fruit3, fruit4, fruit5, fruit6]:\n",
    "            cakes.append(make_cake(flour, cream, fruit))\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, we first try to make a decision on the type of flour. Once that is determined, we will move on to make a decision on the type of cream, and so on. Basically, for our problem, the answer, which is a cake, is defined by this tuple (flour, cream, fruit) and we build this incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's generalize this. What if all the choices that we make during our answer generation can be compatible? For example, assuming flour 1 does not work well with cream2, flour3 does not work well with cream1, cream1 and fruit3 does not taste well together, cream2 and fruit1 or furit6 does not taste well together, how to generate all the possible tasty cakes then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution will become more complicated\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cakes = []\n",
    "for flour in [flour1, flour2, flour3]:\n",
    "    for cream in [cream1, cream2]:\n",
    "        if (flour, cream) in [(flour1, cream2), (flour3, cream1)]:\n",
    "            continue  # jump out of the current iteration, and continue to the next iteration\n",
    "        for fruit in [fruit1, fruit2, fruit3, fruit4, fruit5, fruit6]:\n",
    "            cakes.append(make_cake(flour, cream, fruit))\n",
    "            if (cream, fruit) in [(cream1, fruit3), (cream2, fruit1), (cream2, fruit6)]:\n",
    "                continue\n",
    "            cakes.append(make_cake(flour, cream, fruit))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the logic flow becomes a bit more involved. What if the number of steps to generate a single answer is big then? In this case, as you can easily imagine, it is infeasible to write all those for loops and conditions. Or What if the number of steps for each stage is not a determinant 不是一个确定的数值? We cannot use the simple for loop solution as shown in the above, but can refer to backtracking instead."

    "Backtracking allow you to resolve the following problem in a tractable way: how do we systematically and exhaustively generate all the possible tuples that define our answers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractly, assuming you are trying to find out all possible sequences $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n$ for which a property $P_{n}(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n)$ holds, where each item $x_{k}$ comes from a domain $D_{k}$, in order to systematically examine all fruitful possibilities while exiting gracefully situations that have been fully explored, we can have the following meta algorithms (From Knuth's TAOCP 5B):\n",
    "* B1. [Initialize] Set I = 1, and initialize the data structures needed later.\n",
    "* B2. [Enter level I] (Now $P_{I-1}(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_{I-1})$) holds. If I > n, we have a solution $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n$ and go to B5. Otherwise, set $x_{I} =$ min element in $D_{I}$.\n",
    "* B3. [Try $x_{I}$] If $P_{I}(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_{I})$ holds, update the data structure in order to test $P_{I+1}$, then set I = I + 1 and go to B2.\n",
    "* B4. [Try another value for $x_{I}$] If $x_{I} != $ max element in $D_{I}$, set $x_{I}$ to next larger value and go to B3.\n",
    "* B5. [Backtrack] Set I = I - 1. If I > 0, downdate the data structures by undoing the changes recently made in step B3, and return to B4. (Otherwise stop).\n",

    "In fact, if we model a given instance of a problem as a node and a single item $x_{k}$ (the thing we are currently trying to add to our partial result) as an edge, then all those different partially built candidates set can be formed into a tree structure as the following:\n",
    "![Tree](source/lesson10_DFS_treenode.png)\n",
    "Each partial cnadidate is a path from the root to a certain subtree's root. If our testing fails with a specific candidate set, for example $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $x_{3}$, then the whole subtree rooted at the end pooint of edge $x_{3}$ will not be explored. After this, we will try to see whether we can add another candidate, which means we will go back to the parent of a node and then try to go deeper along another path in our tree.\n",

    "### 9.1.3 Description of the method [Refer to Backtracking Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)\n",
    "This subsection is part of supplementary materials for better understanding of backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking algorithm enumerates a set of partial candidates that, in principle, could be completed in various ways to give all the possible solutions to the given problem. The completion is done incrementally, by a sequence of candidate extension steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the partial candidates are represented as the nodes of a tree structure, the potential search tree. Each partial candidate is the parent of the candidates that differ from it by a single extension step; the leaves of the tree are the partial candidates that cannot be extended any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree recursively, from the root down, in depth-first order. At each node c, the algorithm checks whether c can be completed to a valid solution. If it cannot, the whole sub-tree rooted at c is skipped (pruned). Otherwise, the algorithm (1) checks whether c itself is a valid solution, and if so reports it to the user; and (2) recursively enumerates all sub-trees of c. The two tests and the children of each node are defined by user-given procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the actual search tree that is traversed by the algorithm is only a part of the potential tree. The total cost of the algorithm is the number of nodes of the actual tree times the cost of obtaining and processing each node. This fact should be considered when choosing the potential search tree and implementing the pruning test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudocode\n",
    "<font color='red' size=15> *** </font>\n",
    "In order to apply backtracking to a specific class of problems, one must provide the data P for the particular instance of the problem that is to be solved, and six procedural parameters, root, reject, accept, first, next, and output. These procedures should take the instance data P as a parameter and should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "root(P): return the partial candidate at the root of the search tree.\n",
    "reject(P,c): return true only if the partial candidate c is not worth completing.\n",
    "accept(P,c): return true if c is a solution of P, and false otherwise.\n",
    "first(P,c): generate the first extension of candidate c.\n",
    "next(P,s): generate the next alternative extension of a candidate, after the extension s.\n",
    "output(P,c): use the solution c of P, as appropriate to the application.\n",
    "The backtracking algorithm reduces the problem to the call bt(root(P)), where bt is the following recursive procedure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "procedure bt(c)\n",
    "  if reject(P,c) then return\n",
    "  if accept(P,c) then output(P,c)\n",
    "  s ← first(P,c)\n",
    "  while s ≠ NULL do\n",
    "    bt(s)\n",
    "    s ← next(P,s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage considerations\n",
    "The reject procedure should be a boolean-valued function that returns true only if it is certain that no possible extension of c is a valid solution for P. If the procedure cannot reach a definite conclusion, it should return false. An incorrect true result may cause the bt procedure to miss some valid solutions. The procedure may assume that reject(P,t) returned false for every ancestor t of c in the search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm depends on reject returning true for candidates that are as close to the root as possible. If reject always returns false, the algorithm will still find all solutions, but it will be equivalent to a brute-force search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accept procedure should return true if c is a complete and valid solution for the problem instance P, and false otherwise. It may assume that the partial candidate c and all its ancestors in the tree have passed the reject test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general pseudo-code above does not assume that the valid solutions are always leaves of the potential search tree. In other words, it admits the possibility that a valid solution for P can be further extended to yield other valid solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and next procedures are used by the backtracking algorithm to enumerate the children of a node c of the tree, that is, the candidates that differ from c by a single extension step. The call first(P,c) should yield the first child of c, in some order; and the call next(P,s) should return the next sibling of node s, in that order. Both functions should return a distinctive \"NULL\" candidate, if the requested child does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the root, first, and next functions define the set of partial candidates and the potential search tree. They should be chosen so that every solution of P occurs somewhere in the tree, and no partial candidate occurs more than once. Moreover, they should admit an efficient and effective reject predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early stopping variants\n",
    "The pseudo-code above will call output for all candidates that are a solution to the given instance P. The algorithm can be modified to stop after finding the first solution, or a specified number of solutions; or after testing a specified number of partial candidates, or after spending a given amount of CPU time."

    "### 9.1.4 Python Loop Control: Break, Continue, Pass, and Else [ref1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html), [ref2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-break-continue-and-pass-statements-when-working-with-loops-in-python-3)\n",
    "This subsection is part of supplementary materials for better understanding loop control in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Break\n",
    "The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop. In more details, the break statement provides you with the opportunity to exit out of (i.e., terminiate) the current loop when an external condition is triggered. You’ll put the break statement within the block of code under your loop statement, usually after a conditional if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example that uses the break statement in a for loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(10):\n",
    "    number = number + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if number == 5:\n",
    "        break    # break here\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('Number is ' + str(number))\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Out of loop')\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. In this small program, the variable number is initialized at 0. Then a for statement constructs the loop as long as the variable number is less than 10.\n",
    "2. Within the for loop, the number increases incrementally by 1 with each pass because of the line number = number + 1.\n",
    "3. Then, there is an if statement that presents the condition that if the variable number is equivalent to the integer 5, then the loop will break.\n",
    "4. Within the loop is also a print() statement that will execute with each iteration of the for loop until the loop breaks, since it is after the break statement.\n",
    "5. To see when we are out of the loop, we have included a final print() statement outside of the for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run this code, our output will be the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number is 1\n",
    "Number is 2\n",
    "Number is 3\n",
    "Number is 4\n",
    "Out of loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shows that once the integer number is evaluated as equivalent to 5, the loop breaks, as the program is told to do so with the break statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The break statement causes a program to break out of a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continue\n",
    "The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop. In more details: the continue statement gives you the option to skip over the rest part of the current iteration where an external condition is triggered, but to go on to complete the rest (next iterations) of the loop. That is, the current iteration of the loop will be disrupted, but the program will continue to execute next iterations of the loop. The continue statement will be within the block of code under the loop statement, usually after a conditional if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same for loop program as in the Break Statement section above, we’ll use a continue statement rather than a break statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(10):\n",
    "    number = number + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if number == 5:\n",
    "        continue    # continue here\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('Number is ' + str(number))\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Out of loop')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The difference in using the continue statement rather than a break statement is that our code will continue despite the disruption when the variable number is evaluated as equivalent to 5. Let’s look at our output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number is 1\n",
    "Number is 2\n",
    "Number is 3\n",
    "Number is 4\n",
    "Number is 6\n",
    "Number is 7\n",
    "Number is 8\n",
    "Number is 9\n",
    "Number is 10\n",
    "Out of loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we see that the line Number is 5 never occurs in the output, but the loop continues after that point to print lines for the numbers 6-10 before leaving the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the continue statement to avoid deeply nested conditional code, or to optimize a loop by eliminating frequently occurring cases that you would like to reject. The continue statement causes a program to skip certain factors that come up within a loop, but then continue through the rest of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pass\n",
    "The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyEmptyClass:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def initlog(*args):\n",
    "    pass   # Remember to implement this!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When an external condition is triggered, the pass statement allows you to handle the condition without the loop being impacted in any way; all of the code will continue to be read unless a break or other statement occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same code block as above, let’s replace the break or continue statement with a pass statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(10):\n",
    "    number = number + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if number == 5:\n",
    "        pass    # pass here\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('Number is ' + str(number))\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Out of loop')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The pass statement occurring after the if conditional statement is telling the program to continue to run the loop and ignore the fact that the variable number evaluates as equivalent to 5 during one of its iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll run the program and take a look at the output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number is 1\n",
    "Number is 2\n",
    "Number is 3\n",
    "Number is 4\n",
    "Number is 5\n",
    "Number is 6\n",
    "Number is 7\n",
    "Number is 8\n",
    "Number is 9\n",
    "Number is 10\n",
    "Out of loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "By using the pass statement in this program, we notice that the program runs exactly as it would if there were no conditional statement in the program. The pass statement tells the program to disregard that condition and continue to run the program as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pass statement can create minimal classes, or act as a placeholder when working on new code and thinking on an algorithmic level before hammering out details.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Else in a Loop\n",
    "Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the same code block as above:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(10):\n",
    "    number = number + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if number == 5:\n",
    "        break    # continue here\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('Number is ' + str(number))\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"I have already count to 10!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "print('Out of loop')\n",
    "```\n",
    "After we run the program and look at the result, we can find that the else statement is not executed since the loop is terminated by a break statement, failing to iterate over the list range(10).\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number is 1\n",
    "Number is 2\n",
    "Number is 3\n",
    "Number is 4\n",
    "Out of loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we change the if condition for the break statement as the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(10):\n",
    "    number = number + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if number == 15:\n",

    "    print('Number is ' + str(number))\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"I have already count to 10!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "print('Out of loop')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output becomes:\n",
